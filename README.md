# DATA IN NEWS
How journalists use data in their reporting or in their writing can be viewed as a reflection of the countryâ€™s demand for statistics and data. Back in 2020, I developed an indicator model (for The World Bank) to assess the use of data by Nepali news portals based on the methodology proposed by Klein, Galdin, and Mohamedou 2016. 

As of 9th February 2020, the results showed that very few news articles indicate the source of data or mention development indicators. However, articles that discuss data, reports, research, statistics, and related topics do critically engage with these ideas.

Unfortunately, the data collection process was halted because we ran out of our AWS Activate for Startups credits.
